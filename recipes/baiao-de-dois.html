    <h2>BAIÃO DE DOIS (RICE AND BLACK-EYED PEAS COOKED TOGETHER)</h2>
    <p>“Baião de dois” is a classic dish from Northeast Brazil. The recipe comes from the state of Ceará, but can be found all over Brazil, 
        and there are innumerable variations for it.</p>
    <p>The curious name of this recipe is an allusion to “Baião” – a Brazilian traditional rhythm – and was immortalized by Humberto Teixeira 
        and Luís Gonzaga in the homonymous popular song. “Baião” style is danced in a close embrace, so as in this recipe rice and beans are cooked together.</p>
